## phase 2 description
This game has a new halloween theme, with pumpkins as rocks,
a witch on a broom as the player, and bats as the original enemy.
There is a new powerup that spawns starting at level 3, a potion,
which gives the player an extra life if they have already lost any,
and refills the players shield. There is also a tougher enemy, a
skeleton, that appears starting with the 4th level, and is harder
to kill and does more damage to the player. The tough enemy, skeleton,
is harder to kill will each level, because its health goes up by 10
for each passed level.


I attempted to add a multiplayer function, where instead of hitting
play you hit the number of players, but I could not figure it out
properly and ultimately removed it.
